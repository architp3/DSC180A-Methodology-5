1. **What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**\
   The most interesting topic covered in my domain has been using Graph Convolutional Networks to identify long-range dependencies in gene interactions. This method allows not only to learn global structure of DNA but also local subsets to learn better interactions between genes in an optimized method.
2. **Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**\
   A potential investigation I would like to pursue in my Quarter 2 Project is using Computer Vision to identify Methylene marks in nucleotide sequences, and following by applying Graph Convolutional Networks such as GraphSAGE or GC-MERGE to identify extra-chromosomal DNA (ecDNA).
3. **What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**\
   A potential change I would make to the approach taken in my current Quarter 1 Project is to stack Transformer-based models on top of the GC-MERGE model in order to not only learn about the DNA structure but also allow for users to query the LLM and gain deeper insight about the underlying structure.
4. **What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**\
   Other techniques that I would be interested in using for my project is the use of LLMs and how to pass in learned graphs to make better classifications and identify gene interactions efficiently. I would also like to explore Computer Vision methods and how to build models to identify gene interactions and also be able to distinguish between normal and extra-chromosal DNA.
